- Physical Design

Design steps:

* Logical Design
  - Entity identification
  - Primary Keys
  - Required/Mandatory and Optional Attributes of Entities
  - Relationships between Entities
  - Relationship Matrix

* Entity Relationship Diagram
  - Library Management System Architecture
  - Diagram Design Process
  - Final ER Diagram

* Constraints
  - PRIMARY KEY CONSTRAINT – Table level constraint
  - NOT NULL CONSTRAINT – Column level constraint
  - UNIQUE Constraint – Table Level Constraint
  - CHECK CONSTRAINT - Column Level Constraint
  - FOREIGN KEY Constraint (Referential Integrity)

* Physical Database Design 
  - Create tables
  - CRUD operations
